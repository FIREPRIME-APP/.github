# How to submit an issue report

Before submitting a new issue
- Please make sure that you’re using the latest version of the component. 
- It would be very much appreciated if you would search the project bug tracker to avoid creating a duplicate issue.

Your issue should include at least the following information:
- If you report a bug, please include steps to reproduce it. Please add a step by step documentation and screenshots if applicable and your operating system.
- If you report an enhancement request, please describe enough details so that others can understand it.

This project uses a set of labels that are used to differentiate 3 kinds of issues:
1. **"bug"**: bugs/malfunctions.
2. **"enhancement"**: new features or improvements.
3. **"question"** or **"help wanted"**: asking for assistance.

It is recommended to use always one of these 3 labels to characterise the issue.

Besides these labels, there are 2 labels to indicate that the issue is special:
1. **"blocking"**: a critical issue, something to be handled as soon as possible.
2. **"nicetohave"**: a low priority issue. 

At some point, a (non-help for assistance) issue can be closed without include any modification in the code, in this case the issue will be labelled using:
1. **"duplicate"**: there are more than one issue concerning the same fact. In this case, the person closing the issue will include the reference of the issue that is kept as a comment (e.g. #13).
2. **"invalid"** or **"wontfix"** if the issue is discarded. In this case, the person closing the issue will include the reason as a comment.
