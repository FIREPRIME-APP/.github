Wildfires are increasingly problematic in Europe, with recent unprecedented events causing extensive damage near Wildland-Urban Interface settlements. These fires pose complex civil protection challenges, highlighting a lack of awareness and preparedness among affected communities. Inspired by successful international frameworks like Firewise and FireSmart, FIREPRIME aims to establish an EU-wide program promoting fire resilience in WUI communities.

The **FIREPRIME App** is a mobile application that features a structured questionnaire that evaluates key factors influencing the house vulnerability to wildfires combined with the inherent wildfire risk of the area (hazzard). In addition to this risk assessment, the application provides personalized recommendations to improve the safety of the house, guiding users on effective measures to reduce the wildfire risk.
